# cleanbeauty

I've always been interested in sustainable beauty and wanted to explore how product interest and demand varies across Sephora's [Clean at Sephora](https://www.sephorastands.com/sustainability/) range. All data visualizations were produced using plotly.py and can be viewed [here](/output).

Summary:

1. From a sample of ~9000 products, 1125 items were identified as ‘clean beauty’ products. 
2. Clean products are mostly concentrated in face and body categories. Very few eye, lip and hair products are formulated without parabens, sulfates SLS/SLES, phthalates, mineral oils, formaldehyde etc. 
3. Median prices vary product categories, body and face products have higher median prices, followed by lip and eye products, and hair the lowest. Distribution of prices vary the most across body and face products, and the least among eye and hair.
4. Across top reviewed clean brands, face and body products garner the most reviews, followed by lip, eyes and seldom hair. 
5. Brands with narrower product ranges tend to garner more reviews. The converse is also observed.
